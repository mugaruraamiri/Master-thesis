Like many developing countries, Rwanda medical needs outgrew its medical resources. Rural areas are the ones with huge burden of diseases yet with low resources. Limited number of skilled medical workers and lack of infrastructures are the major challenges that rural community faces. The purpose of this work is to develop and design an affordable remote diagnosing system based on Arduino combined with a smartphone, using various health care sensors and open-source frameworks to assist Healthcare Community workers (CHWs) in rural areas of Rwanda. The system can collect and display different vital signs through mobile technology such as Android and transmit the data via mobile wireless technologies, for doctors performing remote diagnosis. The system can also generate alerts and deliver healthcare related educational content to assist CHWs in better decision-making.
